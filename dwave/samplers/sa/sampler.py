class SimulatedAnnealingSampler(dimod.Sampler, dimod.Initialized):
    """Simulated annealing sampler for binary quadratic models.

    `Simulated annealing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing>`_
    can be used for heuristic optimization or approximate Boltzmann sampling. This
    implementation approaches the equilibrium distribution by performing updates
    at a sequence of decreasing temperatures, terminating at the target
    :math:`\\beta`.\ [#]_ By default each spin is updated once in a fixed order per point
    per :math:`\\beta` according to a Metropolis-Hastings update. When :math:`\\beta`
    is large the target distribution concentrates, at equilibrium, over ground
    states of the model. Samples are guaranteed to match the equilibrium for
    long, smooth :math:`\\beta` schedules.

    .. [#] :math:`\\beta` represents the inverse temperature, :math:`1/(k_B T)`,
       of a `Boltzmann distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution>`_
       where :math:`T` is the thermodynamic temperature in kelvin and :math:`k_B`
       is Boltzmann's constant.

    (1983). "Optimization by Simulated Annealing". Science. 220 (4598): 671â€“680

        Ocean SDK versions earlier than 8.0 supported also a

        """Sample from a binary quadratic model.

        Args:
            bqm: Binary quadratic model to be sampled.

            beta_range:
                A 2-tuple or list defining the beginning and end of the
                :math:`\\beta`\ [#]_ schedule. The schedule is
                interpolated within this range according to the value specified
                by ``beta_schedule_type``. Default range is set based on the
                total bias associated with each node.

            num_reads:
                Number of reads. Each read is generated by one run of the
                simulated annealing algorithm. If ``num_reads`` is not explicitly
                given, it is selected to match the number of initial states
                given. If initial states are not provided, only one read is
                performed.

            num_sweeps:
                Number of sweeps used in annealing. If no value is provided
                and ``beta_schedule`` is None, the value defaults to 1000.

            num_sweeps_per_beta (int, optional, default=1)
                Number of sweeps to perform at each :math:`\\beta`. One sweep
                consists of a sequential Metropolis update of all spins.

            beta_schedule_type:
                :math:`\\beta` schedule type, or how the :math:`\\beta` values
                are interpolated  between the given ``beta_range``. Supported
                values are:

                * "linear"

                * "geometric"

                * "custom"

                "custom" is recommended for high-performance applications, which
                typically require optimizing :math:`\\beta` schedules beyond those
                of the "linear" and "geometric" options, with bounds beyond those
                provided by default. ``num_sweeps_per_beta`` and
                ``beta_schedule`` fully specify a custom schedule.

            beta_schedule:
                Sequence of :math:`\\beta` values swept. Format must be compatible
                with ``numpy.array(beta_schedule, dtype=float)``. Values should
                be non-negative.

            seed:
                Seed to use for the PRNG. Specifying a particular seed with a
                constant set of parameters produces identical results. If not
                provided, a random seed is chosen.

            initial_states:
                One or more samples, each defining an initial state for all the
                problem variables. Initial states are given one per read, but
                if fewer than ``num_reads`` initial states are defined,
                additional values are generated as specified by
                ``initial_states_generator``. See :func:`~dimod.as_samples` for a
                description of "samples-like".

            initial_states_generator:
                Defines the expansion of ``initial_states`` if fewer than
                ``num_reads`` are specified:

                * "none":
                    If the number of initial states specified is smaller than
                    ``num_reads``, raises ``ValueError``.

                * "tile":
                    Reuses the specified initial states if fewer than
                    ``num_reads`` or truncates if greater.

                * "random":
                    Expands the specified initial states with randomly generated
                    states if fewer than ``num_reads`` or truncates if greater.

            randomize_order:
                When `True`, each spin update selects a variable uniformly at random.
                This method is ergodic, obeys detailed balance and preserves symmetries
                of the model.

                When `False`, updates proceed sequentially through the labeled variables
                on each sweep so that all variables are updated once per sweep. This method:

                * can be non-ergodic in special cases when used with ``proposal_acceptance_critera=="Metropolis"``.

                * can introduce a dynamical bias as a function of variable order.

                * has faster per spin update than the True method.

            proposal_acceptance_criteria:
                When "Gibbs", each spin flip proposal is accepted according
                to the Gibbs criteria.
                When "Metropolis", each spin flip proposal is accepted according
                to the Metropolis-Hastings criteria.

            interrupt_function (function, optional):
                A function called with no parameters between each sample of
                simulated annealing. If the function returns True, simulated
                annealing terminates and returns with all of the samples and
                energies found so far.

        Returns:
            A `dimod.SampleSet` for the binary quadratic model.

            The `info` field of the sample set contains information about the sampling procedure:
            1. the beta range used,
            2. the beta schedule type used, and
            3. timing information (details below).

            Timing information is categorized into three: preprocessing, sampling, and
            postprocessing time. All timings are reported in units of nanoseconds.

            Preprocessing time is the total time spent converting the BQM variable type (if
            required), parsing input arguments, and determining an annealing schedule. Sampling time
            is the total time the algorithm spent in sampling states of the binary quadratic model.
            Postprocessing time is the total time spent reverting variable type and creating a
            `dimod.SampleSet`.

        Examples:
            This example runs simulated annealing on a binary quadratic model
            with various input parameters.

    The assumed usage of annealing is optimization. Defaults are chosen
    so that at the hot temperature is fast mixing, and so that at low
    temperature the rate of excitations is small, exploiting a simple
    approximation to the ground state energy space to determine a low
    temperature bound and a worst case approximation to energy
    distribution to determine the high temperature bound.

    Args:
        h (dict):
            External field of Ising model (also called linear bias)

        J (dict):
            Couplings of Ising model (also called quadratic biases)

        max_single_qubit_excitation_rate (float, optional, default = 0.01):
            Targeted single qubit excitation rate at final temperature.
            We can set this value small to lower the probability of
            excitations at the end of the anneal, combined with a simple
            approximation to the ground-state energy structure.
            For standard schedule types (such as geometric), a trade-off
            exists between this threshold and time to solution
            (exploiting multiple restarts).

        scale_T_with_N (bool, optional, default = False):
            The expected number of excitations at finite temperature scales
            with the number of variables. For non-vanishing probability
            of the ground state it is necessary for T to scale to zero
            with N. A simplified approximation to the ground-state energy
            structure is used - for high precision problems T may not scale.

    Assume each variable in J is also in h.

    Generally one should optimize min_beta, max_beta and the shape of the schedule
    to maximize some objective such as time to solution.
    The approximations here are simplified, and can be far from optimal in some cases. Use
    custom schedules to address such cases.
    Approximations used are of complexity O(number of biases), O(1) approximations are also
    possible, as are stronger approximations, but methods are not bottlenecks in practice.
    We use the maximum bias per spin to give an upper bound on the gap, allowing the initial
    sweeps to be fast mixing.
    We use an approximation to the minimum bias per spin to give a lower bound on the minimum
    energy gap, such that for the final sweeps states are highly unlikely to excite away from
    a global (or local) minimum.
